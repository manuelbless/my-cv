        <h2>Hello...</h2>
        <p class="intro">As you may have noticed above, I go by the name Emmanuel Appiah , a developer of my own and a telecommuncations engineer in the making,I've always been a curious person since childhood, but the porpular saying that "Curiosity kills the cat" has always taken a different toll or implication on me because instead of my curiousity leading me to sudden death
        it has rather increased my desire to finding and solve probrems through critical thinking and analysis. I Basically love solving problems.   </p>

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p> I started learning how to code a few years ago ,basically because I developed an interest in developing my own applications and websites and most especially games, and over the years of coding its been fun and tedious at the same time but one thing I always have in mind is that wherever there is a will, there is a way and I'd definately get to my destination. </p>

          <h3>Engineering</h3>
          <p>Personally engineering is a way of thinking, irresepctive of the field one finds himself when one is able to apply Mathematics and scince to come out with a reliable solution to a problem, He is an Engineer. My interest in the field came as a result of curiosity, my love for mathematics and Science and the Joy obtained when a solution to a problem is found. In the university
            I was privileged to be part of some projects, workshops and seminars all leading and grooming me to achieving dreams.  </p>
